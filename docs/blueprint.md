## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#5DADE2) evoking feelings of competence, focus, and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), very close to white, providing a clean, distraction-free workspace.
- Accent color: A muted green (#A3E4D7) for positive actions, highlights, and timeline visualization, to imply personal growth.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short labels, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, long labels and descriptions.
- Simple, consistent icons representing different skill categories. These should be monochromatic and match the accent color.
- Clean, card-based layout for skill entries, emphasizing clarity and easy navigation. The timeline chart should be interactive and intuitive.
- Subtle transitions and animations for adding or updating skills. Animate chart progression and highlighting the analysis during learning activity. Minimal distraction to allow the focus to be on the data.
